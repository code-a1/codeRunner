# codeRunner: Just run your code!
This is a simple tool to run Kotlin scripts, with a minimal UI, developed with Kotlin Multiplatform.

- codeRunner **hilight 10 keywords** from the Kotlin syntax while you're writing your code (but _you can easily extend the keywords highlighted_, also setting different colors!)
- codeRunner allows you to **easily locate errors in your code by clicking on the error's location description** in the stack trace
